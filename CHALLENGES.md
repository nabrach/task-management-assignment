# Challenges & Reflections

## Constraints

**Time** - 8 hours is not a lot of time to learn Angular, NestJs, and create a responsive application

## Considerations

**Experience** - I've worked with React for many years, so while the concepts are different in Angular, there are still some similarities. I have used Express before, so while I haven't used NestJs specifically, I know it's under the hood. I have played with Prisma a little bit in the past, so while I haven't used TypeOrm specifically, it's a similar concept.

## Thought Process

I spent a lot of the time in the beginning making sure I could hook up the backend to the database. Tested the authenticated and unauthenticated api calls with Postman and made sure that the database was populated properly. After that was working I hooked up Angular and made some simple API calls to make sure I was hitting the backend and that the database was populating properly still. There were quite a few concepts I had to wrap my head around with Angular. Seeing that time was running out, I tapped into using Cursor to help speed things up. I felt more comfortable leaning in and prompting it when I had a base level of understanding of the whole application.

## Challenges

Even after using Cursor I didn't have enough time to finish everything. There are still some failing tests, and there are a few responsive design decisions that could have been better, console logs that weren't removed. A lot of little things really. Unrelated to the code, one of the bigger challenges was recording a 5 min video. That's not a lot of time to go over all the features added and mention challenges faced or improvements that could be made etc...so that's why I'm writing this readme to provide a little more context.
